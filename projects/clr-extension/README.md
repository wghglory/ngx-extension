# clr-extension Overview

The **clr-extension** library is designed to augment the capabilities of the Clarity library by providing a set of
reusable components built on top of clarity components.

## Features

1. **dgState Operator**

   The **clr-extension** library introduces the `dgState` operator, which enhances the functionality of the Clarity
   library. This operator streamlines the management of datagrid state, making it more intuitive and efficient for
   developers to work with Clarity datagrids.

2. **Datagrid Utilities**

   The library includes a set of utilities specifically tailored for Clarity datagrids. These utilities aim to simplify
   common tasks and operations related to datagrids, providing developers with a more streamlined and cohesive
   experience when working with Clarity components.

## Requirements

To ensure optimal performance and compatibility, clr-extension requires Angular version 14 or higher.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To use **clr-extension** in your project, you can install it using your preferred package manager. For example, with
npm:

```bash
npm install clr-extension
```

### Usage

```ts
import {dgState, convertToHttpParams} from 'clr-extension';

export class UserDatagridComponent {
  private dgSource = new BehaviorSubject<ClrDatagridStateInterface | null>(null);
  private dgState$ = this.dgSource.pipe(dgState());

  usersState$ = this.dgState$.pipe(
    switchMap((state) => {
      const params = convertToHttpParams(state);
      return this.userService.getUserAPI(params);
    }),
    share(),
  );
}
```
