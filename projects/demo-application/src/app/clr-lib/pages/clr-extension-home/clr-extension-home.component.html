    <h2>Features</h2>
    <h3>Operators</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>clr-lift</strong> introduces powerful operators, such as <code>dgState</code>, designed to amplify the
      functionality of the Clarity library. The <code>dgState</code> operator streamlines datagrid state management,
      offering developers an intuitive and efficient approach when working with Clarity datagrids.
    </p>
    <h3>Utilities</h3>
    <p>
      Our library includes a suite of utilities finely tuned for Clarity components. These utilities simplify common
      tasks and operations, providing developers with a seamless and cohesive experience when interacting with Clarity
      components.
    </p>
    <h3>Components</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>clr-lift</strong> offers a variety of custom components adhering to Clarity styling standards, including
      toast, alert, and more.

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <h3>Installation</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>clr-lift</strong> has specified peer dependencies on ngx-lift and &#64;clr/angular, To integrate
      <strong>clr-lift</strong> in your project, you can install it using your preferred package manager. For example,
      with npm:
    </p>
    <app-code-block [code]="'npm install clr-lift ngx-lift &#64;clr/angular &#64;clr/ui'" lang="shell" />
    <clx-callout>
      <ul class="list-disc space-y-2">
        <li>
          In some cases, a <strong>force installation</strong> may be necessary, particularly if &#64;clr/angular's
          peerDependency mandates a distinct Angular version.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you're not utilizing the latest Angular version, consider setting <code>skipLibCheck: true</code> in
          tsconfig.json to circumvent potential build errors.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you're using Angular 15, please add <code>schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA]</code> to AppModule to suppress
          the error.
        </li>
        <li>
