      The RxJS operator <code>combineLatest</code> is frequently employed to merge multiple observables, triggering
      emissions whenever any of the source observables emits a value. However, a limitation arises as it mandates all
      sources to emit at least once. In UI scenarios, <code>combineLatest</code> is often employed to construct a view
      model observable (<code>vm$</code>). When one of the sources is a <code>Subject</code>, using
      <code>vm$</code> with the async pipe becomes problematic because the <code>Subject</code> may not emit any values
      initially. This issue is elegantly addressed by the augmented functionality of the
      <code>combineLatestEager</code> function.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>combineLatestEager</code> seamlessly extends the capabilities of <code>combineLatest</code> by incorporating
      <code>startWith(null)</code> for each <code>Subject</code> present in the provided sources. This augmentation
      ensures that the combined observable initializes with a null value for each <code>Subject</code>, resolving the
      challenge posed by <code>combineLatest</code> in scenarios where initial emissions from certain sources are not
      guaranteed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In most cases, the aforementioned approach should work seamlessly for you. However, when dealing with numerous
      observables, it might become challenging to distinguish which ones lack initial emissions. For such scenarios,
      <strong
        >you have the flexibility to set the second parameter to true in combineLatestEager, which appends
        <code>startWith(null)</code> for all source observables</strong
      >. This option becomes especially valuable when dealing with situations where ensuring initial emissions is
      crucial.
