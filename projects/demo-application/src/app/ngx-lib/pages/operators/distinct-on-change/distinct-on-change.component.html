      RxJS provides the <code>distinctUntilChanged</code> operator, which is useful for preventing duplicated emissions
      within an observable stream. However, there are scenarios where we not only want to avoid duplicates but also need
      to execute a callback function, such as displaying a toast, when a value changes after the initial emission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter the <code>distinctOnChange</code> operatorâ€”an lift designed to enhance RxJS Observables. This operator takes
      two crucial parameters: <code>onChangeCallback</code> and <code>comparator</code>. The
      <code>onChangeCallback</code> is a callback function that triggers whenever a distinct value is encountered in the
      observable stream. It receives both the previous distinct value and the current value as arguments, allowing you
      to perform specific actions based on this change. Meanwhile, the optional <code>comparator</code> function, with a
      default behavior of strict equality comparison (<code>===</code>), determines whether two values are considered
      equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>distinctOnChange</code> operator is particularly valuable in scenarios where you not only seek distinct
      values but also desire to execute custom logic or side effects when changes occur in the observable data. This
      flexibility makes it a powerful tool for handling various real-time or user interaction scenarios within your
      RxJS-powered applications. Integrate <code>distinctOnChange</code> into your projects to streamline asynchronous
      data processing, make observables more versatile, and enhance the overall reactivity of your application.
